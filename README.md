# WTF - My Work

Hello!

We had 1 week to make a game, and our theme was "WTF". Our idea was simple: a big and small boy that help each other to complete the level.

My responsibilities in this game were a bit of player controller, animation system, throwing stone mechanic, and the whole audio system.

The most challenging part in player movement for me was the new input system. Our team decided to use the new input system, and Vide made the system. The challenging part for me was to understand it and implement the movement logic because I am used to the old one. It was interesting, but I learned a lot from it.

For the animation part, I used raycast a lot to detect certain things, for example, jumping and landing. It was a very basic system. The more challenging part was to implement the animations with the help of state machines. It was my first project with state machines, so my knowledge about it was small, but it grew by the end of the project.

Throwing the stone mechanic was very interesting. The part to pick up the stone and throw it was not a big deal, but timing the animations right was not easy. At that point, I didn't have the knowledge of events you can put in the animations, so instead I made my own timer. It got triggered when the player pressed the "throw" button, and when the float value reached a certain amount, the stone flew away.
