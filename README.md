Hello! In this game I had responsibilty for making some of the player controller. I used raycast a lot to make the system.
Here you can see how it reacts to objects around it.

I use the state machine in unity to make the animation system.

To make the throwing rock system i used a timer to time in the actions. When it picks up, aim and throw.
